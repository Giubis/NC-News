# NC News

NC News is an application that allows users to read articles, post comments, and interact with various topics.

Before running the application, you would need to create two environment configuration files in the root directory:

- `.env.development`
- `.env.test`

Each file must define a `PGDATABASE` variable pointing to the corresponding PostgreSQL database name.
